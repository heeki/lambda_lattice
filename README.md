This repository implements Lambda integration with VPC Lattice both as a client and as a backend.

A larger example architecture and solution has also been open sourced on [AWS Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-vpc-lattice-secure-apis). A corresponding blog post is pending publication.
